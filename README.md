Bare Bones
===========

Screw floats, so equip your website with a flex-based CSS layout for that perfect responsive design we all know and love.


How To Use
===========

For in-depth documentation, head over to the [docs](http://michaelferrell.github.io/bares-bones/). 

Bare Bones uses CSS's flex property, giving you the ability of a flex item to alter its dimensions to consume the space around it.

The grid system is comprised of a percent-based column layout, classes prefixed with .flex-c-.  To ensure a cohesive layout, create a .flex-row class and embed as many columns as desired so long as they add up to 100.

Example:

```
<div class="flex-wrap">
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-c-33">33%</div>
    <div class="flex-c-33">33%</div>
    <div class="flex-c-33">33%</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
